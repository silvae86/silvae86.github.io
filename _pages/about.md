## Curriculum Vitae

My [CV](https://github.com/silvae86/cv/raw/master/cv.pdf) is [open-source](https://github.com/silvae86/cv/), like my work and life philosophy.

## About me

![João Rocha da Silva](/assets/images/about/me.jpg){:class="float-left"}

I hold a PhD in Informatics Engineering from the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, where I also lecture. I specialise on research data management, working on FEUP's InfoLab building Dendro, a solution to help researchers describe and share their datasets in a clear and reusable way.

I have experience in many programming languages Javascript-NodeJS (7+ years), AngularJS, PHP with MVC frameworks, etc.) On the mobile side, I am an experienced freelancer iOS Developer with several Apps published on the App Store.

On the DevOps side, I have experience with testing and automated deployment pipelines using Vagrant, Docker, Jenkins and Bash scripting overall. Continuous integration tools such as Git and GitHub, Travis, Coveralls, Codacy and etc. are a daily part of my work.

Past corporate experience includes two consulting companies: Deloitte and Sysnovare, in which I worked on SAP modules, business blueprinting and software processes restructuring.

I am also a self-taught mechanic on my spare time... and I love Toyota classic cars!

##  Classic Car Mechanics

*Me driving my old 1987 Corolla.*{:class="img-caption"}

I used to have a 1987 Toyota Corolla AE86, also known as Hachi-Roku or literally "eight-six" in Japanese. The car was stolen some years ago, so no more of that. Now I drive a 2003 Diesel Corolla Station Wagon---not exciting but nice to drive.

I have a YouTube channel covering car mechanics and repairs. I called it Toyota Mechanics Video Guides, and you can check it out on YouTube: [Click me](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbjjlEagh5_nduX_u-SkvdQ).
