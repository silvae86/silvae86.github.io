*In construction*

Here is a little bit of my personal history using Macintosh computers, from a pet project Hackintosh circa 2008 to the current MacBook Pros powered by Apple Silicon. This is a nostalgia-filled post with a quite a lot of Apple-fanboyism and personal thoughts, so grab a coffee and enjoy the ride.

## "Aqua": the user interface of the modern-era Macintosh

When Steve Jobs went on stage in the year 2000 to present [the new version of Mac OS](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2000/01/05Apple-Unveils-Mac-OS-X), I was a full-time Windows user, probably still on Windows 98 Second Edition. I had no Internet access nor any interest in Apple keynotes! What Jobs presented at the time, however, must have been nothing short of breath-taking for the people in the audience at the 2000 San Francisco Macworld Conference & Expo.

Mac OS 9 was long in the tooth by this time. Apple was in need of a new Operating System with modern features such as [preemptive multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-emptive_multitasking) (essential for the Internet-connected future) and [memory protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_protection), which separated the memory accessible to different processes into their own separate segments[^memory-protection]. This new OS would, according to Jobs, "be the foundation on which Apple would build and deliver its products in for the next 20 years". He was right, since Mac OS X was the basis for [iPhone OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS), which paved the way for the [iPhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone) and consequently, the smartphone revolution that swept the world.

The entirely new user interface of the new Mac OS, called "Aqua", was completely different than everything Redmond had to offer at the time. Its luminous and transparent elements took advantage of a new graphics system, called 'Quartz'. Jobs explained how Quartz was actually based on the same PDF technology used to render documents.

## 2007 - Trying Mac OS X on a budget: Hackintosh!

I made my switch to the Mac around 2008, while I was still an MSc. student of Informatics Engineering. First, I started by trying to convert my back-then desktop computer into a *Hackintosh* running 10.5 Leopard. Looking back, it was a terrible choice of hardware, since only Intel could run reliably back then. This ended up playing in my favor in the long term, since I had to start getting acquainted with command line tools and the Unix-way of doing things. At the time it meant working with the Terminal, editing and writing BASh Scripts and understanding `.plist` files.

Kernel panics were frequent, but it was all worth it when it finally booted up. The shadows looked amazing, and using [Adium](http://adium.im), the native Mac cross-platform messaging app for the first time is an experience that I will not forget. I had no money to buy a real Mac, but now I was sure that I wanted my own Mac laptop, even if that meant giving up on playing games in exchange for a superior work machine.

## 2008 - The first Macbook Pro

By the end of 2008 my parents gifted me my first Mac laptop. It was being sold at a great discount, around the time when the Unibody ones started coming in. It was an [Early 2008 MacBook Pro A1260](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.4-15-early-2008-penryn-specs.html) model that came with 10.5 Leopard, and I absolutely loved it. By this time, Windows XP was the most widely used OS. A glowing Apple logo on the back of a computer lid was a rare sight in Portuguese university classrooms---at least outside of a Fine Arts class, where Macs where greatly praised for their tight integration with the Adobe creative suite. The screen on that MacBook Pro was colourful, vibrant and high-resolution (1400x900), resulting in an better viewing experience than on my previous Windows computer, a [Sony Vaio FE12M](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Sony-Vaio-VGN-FE21M-Multimedia-Notebook.1360.0.html), which had excellent color and brightness levels for the time but capped out at 1280x800.

By that time, most students like myself were using Windows XP as their main OS (after all, we were students and needed to play games) and Linux was the OS of choice for those subjects where UNIX was required. On PCs of the time it was common to have to dim the screen to the minimum and cut down CPU clock using [RMClock](https://cpu.rightmark.org/products/rmclock.shtml) if you wanted it to last throughout a 2 hour class.

The battery life of the Mac was worlds apart. It would get 4 hours in class with 25% brightness, so I could actually see what I was typing. The Mac also gave me a window into a UNIX-based system that I could actually daily drive, because GUI apps worked great, and BASh scripting was readily available out of the box.

I hold dear memories of using that computer, since it was my main work tool throughout an [MSc. dissertation](https://hdl.handle.net/10216/58508), starting a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MoleskineFan?app=desktop), and the early stages of what ended up becoming my [Ph.D. thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/10216/83993). [Omnigraffle Pro 5](https://www.omnigroup.com/download) was awesome to design UML Class diagrams in! Unlike [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/previous-versions/microsoft-visio-2007) on Windows or [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/) on Linux, it had nice and smooth shadows, anti-aliased fonts and overall better look. Like in a restaurant, the eyes also eat, right?

The OS was truly **fun** to use, even more so than Windows XP. The subtle, pulsing glow of the default button in a modal window in Snow Leopard...Just [like Steve Jobs did](https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobss-signature-design-style-2014-10), I love the [skeuomorphic design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph) from those days! And while some may consider Windows XP childish with its plasticky buttons and title bars, I also continue to enjoy its contrasty intuitive colors back then.

In his speech Commencement address at Stanford University on June 2005, Steve Jobs talked about how he decided to take a calligraphy class at Reed University when he was in colleged. This came to impact the Macintosh user interface, which according to Jobs, was "the first computer with beautiful typography".  This attention to detail spans across decades of Apple products, where beautiful and clear fonts were chosen for every part of the UI. Take for example the Chicago font, used in the Macintosh from 1984 and 1997 and later slightly modified for the iPod as well.

On the Mac, the subtle animations when a window was minimised and maximised were not only technically impressive for the time, but elegant at the same time. More than providing useless flourish (looking at you, [Compiz](http://www.compiz.org)), they served a purpose and helped the user understand where the window went.

The modal dialogs that popped up when you needed to save a document or answer a prompt kept the user in focus and provided useful hints and shortcuts. The `⌘D` shortcut to always select the Desktop as the target destination saved me more time than I can remember throughout my life time as well!

All in all, I had no idea how spoiled I was during this era of skeuomorphism. Since Yosemite (10.10) every button, scroll bar and top left semaphore in the macOS UI is flat and streamlined, in the name of reducing visual clutter and maintaining a sleek image. It exchanged some of its fun for sharpness and professionalism and became somewhat more serious.

## 2012 - The White Macbook Unibody - The definition of a student laptop

Like many of its kind, my 2008 Macbook Pro died a painful death when its GPU, the [flawed nVidia 8600GT](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/so-are-all-mbp-owners-with-the-8600m-gt-cards-screwed.515067/), finally gave up on me around 2012.

Meet my 2010 MacBook Unibody White with an Intel 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo processor, which I bought after my 2008 MacBook died. It was a beaten up machine that I got second hand for the reasonable price of € 450 at the time. At such a low price for the time, it had some problems that I figured I could fix with my trusty precision screwdriver set, some thermal paste and a few new parts...

It came with a 1000-plus cycle count battery, whose internal resistance made the laptop hot to work on and short-lasting. It was missing a couple of keys in the keyboard and was powered by an aftermarket 'El Cheapo' power adapter lighter than most of today's mobile phones. I still remember how the charger's terrible grounding would give me shocks in the ears when I was wearing earbuds. But hey, when you are a Ph.D. student you can't be picky, and it was nothing I could not fix! I proceeded to repair and upgrade it as much as I could, with a new aftermarket battery (still delivers up to 4 hours of light use to this day), a 250 GB Samsung 840 SSD, 8GB RAM, and the missing keyboard keys.

The first great characteristic of this laptop is its The thing about this laptop is that you can run many versions of Mac OS X, from Snow Leopard (10.6) up to Catalina (10.15) through the [unofficial patcher](https://github.com/dosdude1/macos-catalina-patcher) by dosdude1.

## 2014 - MacBook Pro Retina 15'' - The first Retina experience

The first Retina MacBook Pro I ever used came out of the box with [Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mavericks). Up to that time, on the most widely used Operating Systems, one physical pixel was always used to render a single logical pixel in an UI (1:1 scaling). On a Retina display, 4 physical pixels are used to render the same logical pixel, causing the interface to be scaled to fill in the extra pixels. This *[HiDPI mode](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI)*, coined by Apple as Retina, allows for much crisper images and typography everywhere, almost resembling printed text and photographs.

{:.float-img-left}
![The ](/assets/images/post-images/2022-03-10-my-history-with-mac-computers/macbook_pro_retina_2015.jpg)<br>*That's me in a late night around 2015 working on my Ph.D. thesis*

As always, it was Apple's *execution* of this new high pixel density UI all throughout the OS X that made the difference. When Mavericks came out, the UI was beautifully remapped to a high-pixel version, with pixellated elements being few and far in between. Developers were also quick to update their apps' assets to provide the Retina display experience.

HiDPI mode came to Windows as well, with many of the Windows native scaling gracefully. However, many older apps and less user-facing areas of the OS [looked bad back then](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/living-a-highdpi-desktop-lifestyle-can-be-painful), since they never got an overhaul like that done upon the release of OS X Mavericks. Even to this day on Windows 10 you will sometimes get apps with tiny buttons and fonts because the scaling is not working properly. Fortunately this is rare and far in between.

This laptop was my lab workhorse in my last years of research as a Ph.D. student. My particular one was the base i7 at 2.0 GHz, without a dedicated graphics card. The main reason was that I was afraid of GPU defects after my 2008 MacBook Pro died because of a bad GPU, and the price was much lower. The Intel Iris Pro is a very capable graphics card for most
everyday uses outside of gaming and any sort of 3D modelling. Even video rendering was quite fast in Final Cut Pro X.

The computer was solidly built, with a long battery life, the best screen I had ever seen in a laptop, a very crisp keyboard. Apple had also learned from their overheating mistakes of the past and provided the laptop with a couple of very slim air intake notches at the left and right edges of the bottom case.

This greatly improved airflow inside the case and ensured a quieter working environment. You would really notice the cool air flowing towards the inside of the machine when under load and the fans spun up. No wonder the MacBook Pros from 2010-2012 had the habit of overheating and dying... No cool air intake at all!


## 2017 - MacBook Pro 13'' - Great connectivity, mid-range power

By 2017 I had to update my personal laptop with a more recent machine, as my Unibody Macbook White from 2010 was starting to show its age. The 15'' MacBook Pro was my lab-supplied machine and was simply too large to lug around everywhere. Looking for a personal machine that I was going to buy with my own money, I started looking around on second hand market.

I ended up buying a second hand Early 2014 13'' Retina MacBook Pro, with a dual-core i7 at 3.0GHz, with 16GB of RAM, for 750€. The most powerful and rare configuration, the computer had some issues: very worn out keys, a MagSafe charger with a torn cable, a battery on its last legs, and a bad case of the Retina Macbook Pro [delamination issue](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/20/macbook-pro-anti-reflective-repair-program/) in the display. When I bought it, I proceeded to replace the thermal paste, the [battery](/2018/07/04/new-battery-for-my-macbook-pro-retina-13/) and clean up the remains of the bad anti-reflective coating with some [eyeglasses cleaning solution](https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/582699/How+to+remove+anti-glare+coating+effectively), a microfiber cloth, and a lot of patience.

## 2018 - MacBook 12'' - The most gorgeous slow computer ever

In 2018 I bought a Gold 12'' MacBook, looking for a very light laptop that would always be with me in case I needed to write something down or reply to an email quickly while on the road. I have to say, at the beginning my main motivation for choosing this color was the price! This machine cost me €999 back then, since it was on clearance sale.

These machines are notorious for their fragile keyboards based on a new "butterfly mechanism" which replaced the "scissors switch" ones that came before it. This new mechanism was necessary for Apple to build even thinner laptops by reducing the space necessary for the keys to travel. However, such a small gap in the key mechanism made it very susceptible to crumbs and dust, which when stuck inside the key would be almost impossible to flush out, causing dead or stuck keys. Apple released a [guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205662) covering how to clean these keyboards, and more importantly, a [4-year warranty extension](https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks) on the keyboard only counting from the date of purchase. This 4-year warranty gave me the peace of mind that I needed to buy the computer.

I used to joke about how someone's laptop tells something about their job when you look around a meeting table: if it is a very slim and portable machine, you can safely hazard that this person is in a management position. If it is a thick brick of a computer, this person is a professional video editor or a video game developer. If it is somewhere in the middle, like a 15'' MacBook Pro,

## Footnotes

[^memory-protection]: To understand the importance of memory protection, one only has to look at the seriousness of the [Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities](https://meltdownattack.com), which can be weaponised by malicious processes to access data from other processes running on the same machine. They break memory protection, allowing, for example, a malicious process to read your banking passwords from the RAM segment allocated by your browser process). Spectre and Meltdown are especially bad because they are hardware-based vulnerabilities. This means that they are part of most Intel and AMD processors' physical architecture and thus, cannot be patched with a software updated. Only by buying a new computer with a more modern CPU will the problem be solved.
